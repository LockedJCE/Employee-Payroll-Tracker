# Employee-Payroll-Tracker

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create an employee payroll tracker and to apply my javascript skills i've learned this past week or so. It helped me learn to find my target in the html and use that knowledge to write my javascript in the correct way so its hitting its targets and not breaking the webpage. I also learned that it takes a lot of checking back on what changes my code made to the live site and adjusting it where i saw fit. Javascript overall is challenging for me but a fun one at that and something i've enjoyed working through.

## Installation/Usage

There is no need to install my project as it is just a webpage but to access it simply look under the deployments tab and click on my github page. To use simply click "Add Employees" and answer the prompts, it will log your first and last name as well as your salary and calculate an everage salary. Below is a screenshot of what the page should look like upon accessing.
